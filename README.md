 // Brief Description of what you did. 
I developed an API and implemented routes to collect individual nouns and adjectives and integrated them into a service that constructs a custom story for the user.I created a Service the reverses the users input, then returns the data to the controller, which then formats the results and send them to the user.

project looks like its working well, only changes i recommend are removing the validation for reverse it word since that one is supposed to reverse everything in it, and make sure to run "dotnet new gitignore", aside from those small things it seems perfect, great job :)
